### What is Notched Sound Therapy?

Notched sound therapy is a specialized and innovative approach to **managing tinnitus**, a condition that affects [millions of people worldwide](/blog/tinnitus-statistics-how-many-are-affected). Unlike traditional [white noise or masking sounds](/blog/the-power-of-white-noise) that aim to cover up tinnitus, notched therapy works by subtly altering an audio track (often music or broadband noise) to remove, or "notch out," a narrow band of frequencies centered around the individual's specific tinnitus pitch. The theory is that by regularly listening to this notched sound, the brain's auditory pathways can be gradually retrained to pay less attention to the internal tinnitus sounds over time, which may lead to a reduction in their perceived intensity or bothersomeness.

This therapy is considered particularly promising for individuals whose tinnitus is tonal and falls within a specific, identifiable frequency range. The soundscapes available in this collection are designed to target frequencies between **5000Hz and 9000Hz**, a common range where many tinnitus sufferers experience their ringing, buzzing, or hissing sounds.

### Benefits of Notched Sound Therapy

While research is ongoing and individual results can vary, proposed benefits of notched sound therapy include:

- **Tinnitus Relief through Neural Reorganization:** Notched sound therapy aims to reduce the hyperexcitability of neurons in the auditory cortex that correspond to the tinnitus frequency. By selectively reducing energy at that specific frequency band while stimulating adjacent areas, it's hypothesized to promote beneficial neuroplastic changes, helping the brain "unlearn" or suppress the tinnitus sound, resulting in reduced awareness and a more peaceful auditory experience for some users.
- **Improved Focus and Concentration:** Constant tinnitus can make it very difficult to concentrate, especially in quiet environments where the internal sound becomes more prominent. By potentially reducing the perceived loudness or intrusiveness of tinnitus, notched sound therapy may allow individuals to regain focus and improve mental clarity for daily tasks.
- **Enhanced Auditory Processing (Potentially):** Regular exposure to targeted sound therapies like notched audio might help improve aspects of overall auditory health by stimulating the auditory system in specific ways and encouraging more balanced neural activity.
- **Stress Reduction:** Tinnitus is often closely linked with stress and anxiety. The constant presence of the sound can be mentally exhausting and emotionally draining. By offering a potential reduction in tinnitus perception, notched sound therapy may help create a calmer internal auditory environment, thereby promoting relaxation and reducing the stress cycle often associated with bothersome tinnitus.

### For Effective Notched Sound Therapy, Follow These Steps:

#### <Highlighter>Find a Quiet Space:</Highlighter>

The key to successful sound therapy, including notched therapy, is often minimizing external distractions that could interfere with the brain's processing of the therapeutic sound. Choose a calm, peaceful environment where you can focus on the therapy without interruptions. This could be your bedroom, a quiet study, or any secluded area where you can relax.

#### <Highlighter>Select Your Device and Platform:</Highlighter>

Our Notched Sound Therapy tracks are accessible on major streaming platforms: Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, Amazon Music, and Deezer. Choose your preferred service and use your smartphone, tablet, or computer to begin your listening session.

#### <Highlighter>Pick a 10-Minute Sound (or longer as per album tracks):</Highlighter>

The Notched Sound Therapy playlist or album typically includes several tracks, often presented in 10-minute segments (though this collection offers 30-120 min soundscapes), specifically designed to target the 5000Hz to 9000Hz frequency range. Select a track that feels comfortable or pleasant to you, and begin your session.

#### <Highlighter>Adjust the Volume Appropriately:</Highlighter>

Set the volume at a comfortable listening level where the sound is clear but not too loud. It should be engaging enough for your brain to process but not so loud as to cause any strain or discomfort. Excessively high volumes can aggravate tinnitus or cause further hearing issues, so finding a soothing, moderate volume is crucial.

#### <Highlighter>Use Quality [Headphones](/blog/noise-canceling-headphones-for-tinnitus) or Speakers:</Highlighter>

For the most precise delivery of the notched frequencies, using high-quality stereo headphones or good speakers is generally recommended. Clear and accurate audio reproduction will allow you to experience the full intended effects of the notched sound therapy, making it more effective in targeting your specific tinnitus frequencies.

#### <Highlighter>Relax and Listen (Focused but Passive):</Highlighter>

Sit or lie down comfortably. You can close your eyes if you wish, or engage in a quiet, relaxing activity like reading. The key is to allow the notched sound therapy to play in the background. While you don't need to intensely concentrate _on_ the sound, allow yourself to be passively exposed to it. Focusing on your breathing or other relaxation techniques can complement the therapy. The goal is for your brain to gradually adapt over time.

#### <Highlighter>Be Consistent with Daily Listening:</Highlighter>

Consistency is widely considered key to achieving potential long-term benefits with notched sound therapy. Aim to listen to the therapy daily as recommended by research protocols (which often suggest at least an hour a day for several months). Start with manageable sessions (like the 10-minute tracks, or longer segments from the 30-120 min soundscapes available) and maintain a regular practice to give your brain the best chance to adapt and potentially experience a reduction in tinnitus symptoms.

### How Notched Sound Therapy Works for Tinnitus

Tinnitus often arises when the [brain mistakenly interprets or generates aberrant neural signals](/blog/what-role-does-the-brain-play-in-tinnitus) as sound, frequently associated with underlying hearing damage at specific frequencies. Notched sound therapy operates on the principle of **targeted neuroplasticity**. By systematically removing (or "notching out") the specific frequencies that align with the user's tinnitus pitch from a broadband sound or music, the therapy aims to reduce the neural hyperactivity in the auditory cortex corresponding to that tinnitus frequency. The surrounding, un-notched frequencies continue to stimulate the auditory system, which is thought to encourage **lateral inhibition**, effectively "turning down the volume" on the overactive neurons responsible for the tinnitus perception. Over time, this consistent, targeted stimulation (and lack thereof at the notch) may lead to a re-balancing of neural activity and a decrease in the subjective perception of tinnitus.

Unlike traditional [sound masking](/blog/the-power-of-white-noise), which aims to temporarily cover up the tinnitus sound with another external sound, notched sound therapy endeavors to induce longer-term changes in the brain's processing of the tinnitus signal.

### Is Notched Sound Therapy Right for You?

Notched sound therapy is generally considered most potentially effective for individuals who experience **tonal tinnitus** (a tinnitus sound with a relatively stable, perceivable pitch) that falls within a specific frequency range, such as the **5000Hz to 9000Hz** range targeted by these soundscapes. If you are unsure whether your tinnitus is tonal or what its approximate pitch might be, consulting with an [audiologist](/blog/how-audiologists-diagnose-and-treat-tinnitus) is highly recommended. An audiologist can perform tests to help characterize your tinnitus, including pitch matching.

If your tinnitus is non-tonal (e.g., more like a hiss, static, or complex noise) or falls significantly outside the 5000Hz to 9000Hz range, other sound therapy options, such as broadband [white noise or pink noise](/blog/the-power-of-white-noise), or different types of customized sound therapies, might be more appropriate or beneficial. It's important to find a therapy that aligns with your specific tinnitus characteristics and needs to achieve the best possible results.
