Some individuals who have contracted COVID-19 have reported experiencing tinnitus during or after their illness.

The pandemic has led to significant stress, anxiety, and changes in daily lifeâ€”all factors that might influence tinnitus. The challenges of isolation, shifts in work environments, and constant exposure to pandemic-related news may contribute to the onset or worsening of tinnitus for some individuals.
