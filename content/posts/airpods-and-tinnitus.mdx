## <Highlighter>Tips for Managing Tinnitus with AirPods Pro 2</Highlighter>

If you have AirPods Pro 2 and experience tinnitus, leveraging their features thoughtfully might help as part of a broader management strategy:

1.  **Leverage [Active Noise Cancellation (ANC)](/blog/noise-canceling-headphones-for-tinnitus) Mindfully**: Use the **ANC mode** in genuinely loud environments (public transport, airplanes, noisy workplaces) to reduce harmful noise exposure that can worsen tinnitus. However, be cautious about using ANC in already quiet environments, as the resulting silence might make your tinnitus _more_ noticeable (see our article on [Silence and Tinnitus](/blog/can-silence-make-tinnitus-worse)).
2.  **Utilize Personalized Audio Profiles**: Take the reported hearing test feature seriously. Applying your **personalized hearing profile** can potentially make media consumption (music, podcasts, videos) and phone calls more comfortable by adjusting frequencies that might otherwise be harsh or triggering for your tinnitus.
3.  **Set Volume Limits to Protect Hearing**: Use the **"Reduce Loud Audio"** feature in your iPhone’s settings (Settings > Sounds & Haptics > Headphone Safety). This allows you to set a maximum decibel limit for headphone output, helping to [prevent further noise-induced hearing damage](/blog/the-impact-of-noise-pollution-on-tinnitus) that could worsen tinnitus over time.
