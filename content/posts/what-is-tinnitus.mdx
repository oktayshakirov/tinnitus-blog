## <Highlighter>Symptoms of Tinnitus</Highlighter>

Tinnitus symptoms can vary from person to person, with phantom sounds manifesting as ringing, buzzing, humming, or other noises. These sounds can occur in one or both ears and may be continuous or intermittent. Some individuals may also experience somatosensory tinnitus, where certain movements or touch trigger tinnitus symptoms. While most cases of tinnitus are subjective, rare cases of objective tinnitus can be heard by others and often have an identifiable cause.

## <Highlighter>Causes of Tinnitus</Highlighter>

Tinnitus can be linked to various factors, including noise exposure, hearing loss, medications, earwax or ear infections, head or neck injuries, and other conditions such as Ménière's disease or blood vessel problems. While the exact mechanisms behind tinnitus are not fully understood, damage to the inner ear and abnormal interactions between the auditory cortex and neural circuits in the brain are believed to play a role.

## <Highlighter>Diagnosing Tinnitus</Highlighter>

If you suspect you have tinnitus, it is essential to see a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis. Your doctor may examine your ears and conduct tests to rule out underlying causes. In some cases, imaging tests may be ordered. Collaborating with an otolaryngologist or audiologist can provide further evaluation and measurement of hearing and tinnitus severity.

## <Highlighter>Treatment Options</Highlighter>

While there is currently no cure for tinnitus, several treatment approaches can help reduce its symptoms and improve quality of life. Sound therapies, such as using sound generators or hearing aids, can provide relief by masking or distracting from tinnitus sounds. Behavioral therapy, including counseling and cognitive-behavioral techniques, can help individuals cope with tinnitus-related distress. Medications may be prescribed to manage associated conditions like anxiety or depression, although no specific medication exists solely for treating tinnitus.
