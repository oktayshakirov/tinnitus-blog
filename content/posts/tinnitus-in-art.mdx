Many musicians, both historical and contemporary, have experienced tinnitus due to prolonged exposure to loud sounds. Some have channelled their experiences into their compositions, creating pieces that reflect the dissonance of tinnitus or the longing for silence.

Artists have visually represented tinnitus in various ways. Abstract works might use swirling patterns or sharp contrasts to depict the intrusive nature of the condition. More literal interpretations might feature ears, sound waves, or even individuals in states of distress or contemplation.

In cinema and theater, tinnitus has been used as a narrative device. Characters might experience a ringing sound after a traumatic event, symbolizing disorientation or a shift in reality.
